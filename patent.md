# Provisional Patent Draft: MoPAutomation

## Title
**Method and System for Region-Based Automation Execution Using Template-Rendered Operational Procedures with Frontmatter and Orchestrated Workflows**

## Inventor
**Rodney Whiddon**

---

## I. Field of the Invention

This invention relates to cloud automation, specifically to a system for executing region-specific operational procedures (MOPs) generated from Jinja2 templates and YAML frontmatter metadata, orchestrated through a sequential scheduler and executed via Ansible and external pipelines (e.g., Azure DevOps).

---

## II. Summary

This invention describes:
- A markdown-based MOP system rendered via Jinja2 templates
- YAML frontmatter containing routing metadata (e.g., `workbook`)
- Region-specific variable injection across six Azure regions
- MOP grouping into *sequential execution sets* per region
- A Flask API + Ansible automation execution layer
- Integration with Azure DevOps pipelines
- Full logging, replay, and auditability
