I. Field of the Invention

This invention relates to cloud infrastructure automation and procedural orchestration. More specifically, it describes a system and method for rendering markdown-based operational procedures (MOPs) using Jinja2 templates with embedded frontmatter metadata, routing them into predefined categories of automation tasks, and executing them sequentially across cloud regions (e.g., Azure) using Ansible and optionally triggering third-party pipelines (e.g., Azure DevOps).

⸻

II. Background

DevOps workflows often rely on manual, fragile execution of automation tasks, especially when vendors supply templates or provisioning code that lacks integration with enterprise execution pipelines. This creates bottlenecks and inconsistent execution across environments.

There is a need for a self-documenting, regionally aware, automation system that converts human-readable procedures into machine-executable jobs using cloud-scale orchestration.

⸻

III. Summary of the Invention

This invention introduces:
	1.	A system for defining operational automation steps as Jinja2-based markdown templates with YAML frontmatter (“MOPs”).
	2.	A rendering engine that processes region-specific variable files, generating final markdown files for each Azure region.
	3.	A directory structure that clearly separates templates, regional variables, rendered output, execution logic, and logs.
	4.	A scheduler that organizes and executes MOPs in strict sequence within each Azure region and across all regions.
	5.	An execution engine based on Flask and Ansible that reads MOP metadata, selects the correct playbook, injects parameters, and executes automation.
	6.	Optional integration with external CI/CD pipelines, including Azure DevOps, using routing fields in the MOP frontmatter.
	7.	A retry and audit system that logs, retries, or halts workflows on failure for human or automatic intervention.
	8.	A vendor-agnostic model where any compliant Jinja2 template and parameter set can be used, without hardcoding logic.

IV. Detailed Description

The system is implemented in a Git-tracked project directory with the following structure:

MoPAutomation/
	•	templates/: Vendor-supplied Jinja2 MOPs
	•	vars/: Region-specific variable files (YAML or JSON)
	•	rendered/: Output folder for region-specific MOPs
	•	scheduler/: Sequential logic for regional execution
	•	executor/: Flask service and Ansible execution code
	•	playbooks/: Ansible workbooks divided into 12 core categories
	•	logs/: Execution status, stdout/stderr, audit logs

⸻

V. MOP Lifecycle
	1.	Vendor delivers 25 Jinja2 .j2 templates containing YAML frontmatter headers and procedural markdown content.
	2.	The render engine reads variables from each region’s file and renders one markdown file per template per region, resulting in 150 MOPs.
	3.	The resulting markdown documents include both the documentation and executable metadata via YAML frontmatter.
	4.	The regional MOPs are grouped into sets of 25 per region.
	5.	The scheduler processes one region’s MOP set at a time. Within each region, MOPs are executed in strict sequence. One MOP must complete successfully before the next begins.
	6.	Once one region’s set completes, the next region is processed. No overlap or concurrency is allowed.
	7.	Each MOP is executed by reading its frontmatter, selecting the proper playbook, injecting parameters, and calling the Ansible engine.
	8.	If failure occurs, the system halts and logs the error. A CLI or API allows replays and retry operations.

VI. MOP Frontmatter

Each markdown MOP contains structured metadata at the top of the file, such as:
	•	title: Descriptive name of the operation
	•	workbook: Name of the Ansible playbook to invoke
	•	parameters: Dictionary of key-value pairs to inject
	•	region: Region name
	•	optional fields: branch, pipeline_id, depends_on, retries

This metadata drives routing, categorization, and execution.

VII. MOP Scheduling System

Each region has a complete set of 25 MOPs rendered for it. The scheduler accepts an ordered list of regions. Within each region, MOPs are executed one at a time. No region can begin until the previous region has fully completed its batch.

The queue behaves like a nested sequence:
	•	Within region: MOP 1, MOP 2, …, MOP 25
	•	Between regions: Region A → Region B → Region C

Failures are logged, and the scheduler pauses a region if any MOP fails. State is persisted so that the system may resume from the failure point after resolution.

⸻

VIII. Integration with Pipelines

If a MOP includes a pipeline_id or branch, the execution system triggers an Azure DevOps pipeline with the given metadata, waits for completion, and records the status.

⸻

IX. Execution Example
	1.	MOP 03 for region eastus2 calls the aks-init.yml playbook using values from its frontmatter and region variable file.
	2.	Ansible runs with injected variables and produces an output log in logs/aks-eastus2-03.log.
	3.	If successful, the scheduler continues to MOP 04. If not, it halts and stores the error state.

⸻

X. Error Handling and Replay
	•	Each MOP has a UUID or unique identifier
	•	Logs are written with timestamps and statuses
	•	Failures trigger retry logic or pause state
	•	Admins may replay a MOP via CLI or API
	•	All steps are idempotent or detect state before execution

⸻

XI. Claims
	1.	A method for rendering and executing markdown MOPs across cloud regions.
	2.	A system that uses Jinja2 templates with YAML frontmatter to define routing and parameters.
	3.	Execution of MOPs in strict sequence within and across regions.
	4.	A scheduler that queues and manages MOP execution with lock enforcement.
	5.	Use of Ansible to execute playbooks based on MOP metadata.
	6.	Frontmatter-driven selection and injection of automation parameters.
	7.	Logging and retry of failed MOPs via API or CLI.
	8.	Integration with external CI/CD pipelines via structured frontmatter.
	9.	Region-aware batching and audit of all executions.
	10.	Vendor-agnostic template intake requiring no hardcoded routes.

XII. Example Visual Model (Descriptive)

For each region:

eastus2
MOP 01 → MOP 02 → MOP 03 → … → MOP 25

Then continue to:

centralus
MOP 01 → MOP 02 → MOP 03 → … → MOP 25

And so on for all six Azure regions.
