## Risk Mitigation and Safety Controls

### Execution Safety Controls

#### Automated Safeguards
- **Execution Locks**: Prevent multiple regions from executing simultaneously
- **Health Checks**: Continuous monitoring during execution
- **Automatic Rollback**: Triggered by critical failures
- **Rate Limiting**: Controlled execution pace

#### Manual Oversight
